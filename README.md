Welcome to the Pomodoro Planner! We created this website as a tool to help you increase your productivity and stay focused. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that encourages you to stay focused while working by using set intervals of work and rest. Our goal was to recreate this study technique with an integrated to-do list and customizable timer.
